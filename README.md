*** * * Avybe Coding Challenge * * ***

__Instructions:__
For the coding challenge, please make a website using Django, where the user can showcase her profile. So the user will be able to add and edit:
- a profile picture
- a nickname

You don't need to worry about aesthetics, just try to get the functionality done. You will most likely have to use Django forms, which will update the database automatically. Feel free to ask for any clarification or guidance if you're stuck â€“ I can help with that. You can also use google, stack overflow, and the Django documentation for help.
